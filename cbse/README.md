## CBSE class material

Python is in the school syllabus in India, YAY!

This directory has some random material based on content required for the CBSE
CS and IP courses for class eleven and twelve.

These items are essentially things that are mentioned in the syllabus but not
quite covered explicitly in the basic and advanced material as of now.

The idea is to build the content out so that it can be used to train the CBSE
teachers.
