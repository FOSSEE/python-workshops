# Advanced Python Programming

This material covers some advanced Python programming concepts.

The student is supposed to have completed the "Basic Python Programming"
course first before starting on this material.

As done for the basic Python course, the material here is completely hands-on
and requires the use of yaksh for practice, self-assessment, and assessment.

## Pre-requisites

- Students should have completed the basic Python programming material.
- One should have a Python 3.x installation with IPython installed.
- Use a reasonable editor, Canopy will work.
- If one desires a more advanced editor, I suggest VS Code
  (https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free, open source, and very
  powerful.
