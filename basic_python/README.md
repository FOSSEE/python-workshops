# Basic Python Programming

This is a fairly intense two day workshop on learning basic Python
programming. The course is completely hands-on and requires each student to
have access to a computer with the necessary software installed and with
internet access.

The workshop is designed to be taken with our online testing platform called
[yaksh](http://yaksh.fossee.in). After every hands-on lecture, we have a
practice session where students are expected to solve the given problem on our
online platform. The solutions to each problem will be shown and students will
proceed to the next problem. Close to 60 exercises will be solved by the
students over the course of this workshop.

Students will also need to take a programming test to be assessed and receive
certificates.

The course only covers basic Python programming. See the outline of the course
below to see what is covered.



## Intended audience and pre-requisites

This course requires that students have completed our "Introductory Scientific
Computing with Python" course and passed it.

This course is designed to be taken by folks who do not have any significant
programming experience. The students should be comfortable using a computer
and editing text files.

## Software and hardware requirements

A laptop or reasonably configured desktop is recommended since this will be a
hands-on session.

Please install Python 3.x (or 2.7.x if 3.x is not available) for this course.

On Linux, Windows and Mac OS X it is easiest to install Python and many other
useful packages by installing Anaconda. Download the Anaconda Python distribution
for your OS and architecture from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. The instructions to install are available here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

You can use Anaconda or Conda along with the Spyder editor or the VSCode editor.

On many Linux distributions, Python is already available. We suggest that you
install Python 3.x and are comfortable with any text editor. Editors that
integrate with Python would be better.
